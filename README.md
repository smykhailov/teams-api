# MS Teams Graph API Example

The intent of this project is to show an example of [MS Teams Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) usage. This is leveraged by the using [Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) to access API and [Fluent UI React](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/) for UI.
